  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    Hi, I'm Jack Miller, a Computer Science student at the University of Wisconsin-Parkside, graduating in Spring 2026. I'm passionate about software development, with experience in web and mobile development, cybersecurity, and data structures.

    I've worked on a variety of projects, from building a marketplace for books to creating an interactive restaurant website with online ordering. My experience includes working with Java, Python, JavaScript, React, HTML and CSS.

    Beyond academics, I’m involved in my university's Computer Club, where I help organize events. I love tackling real-world problems through software and am always looking for exciting opportunities to learn and grow.

  </p>
    <p>Let's connect and build something awesome!</p>

        a website. I wanted to get more experience, so I created one for them. Through their point of service system I was able to
        turn on online ordering for them hoping to boost sales.
